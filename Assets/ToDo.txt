Things to do:
When ball gathers many object it stops registering other objects.
This is probably because every object in the playerparent is CONSTANTLY colliding with each other object.

Figure out how to remove limit of objects player can pick up.

DAY 2
Figured out how to set limitless objects to attach to origin
also added player rotation on q and e keys
camera zooms out when the player picks up an object, but it goes too far too quickly
set a max limit for camera zoom out
add force to player on x axis to make an auto scroller

DAY 3
Talked about ideas for the game, every idea includes when a piece gets 
destroyed it destroys all other pieces attached to it.  This is because
any object that is in the player "blob" is only attached to ONE object. 
If we set up a parent-child hierarchy for each object in the blob (so that
when an object gets added it is a child of the individual object it was hit by)
then we can set up a recursive structure for when any object gets hit
to send a function call to destroy children to it's children, and then destroy
its children.

This will make it so that when the player blob is struck by an enemy/bullet,
all remaining parts of the player blob have a direct path back to the original
player circle.
